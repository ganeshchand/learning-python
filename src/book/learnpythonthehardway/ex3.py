#  Exercise 3 - Numbers and Maths

print "I will now count my chickens"

print "Hens:", 25 + 30 / 6

print "Roosters:", 100 - 25 * 3 % 4

print "Is it true that 3 + 2 < 5 - 7:", 3 + 2 < 5 - 7


print "Floating number: ", 5 / 2

#
# use from __future__ import division to force the division to be floating point

print "Another floating operation: ", 5 / 2

# After you import division, if you want to force the division to be int

# You need to use // for division

print "Int division", 5 // 2

# In python3, by default, the division gives you float operation.

# Order of operation
